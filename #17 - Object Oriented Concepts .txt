 # 17 - Object Oriented Concepts 
 --------------------------------------------------------
 Classes are one of the most common types in C# 
 A Class Provides a blueprint or a description of what an object looks like
	- What kind of data an object of this type holds
	- What kind of things that an object of this type can do
 A class is not, however, the actual object itself
 Classes are used to create individual objects - called instances - sort of stamping machine that stamps out physical parts
