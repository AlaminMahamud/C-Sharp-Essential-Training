 #18 - Access Modifiers
 -----------------------------------
 `
 By default data and methods defined in a class can only be used inside that class itself - you must choose to expose them
 
 Access modifiers let you specifyhow programs (including yours) that use your classes  can access their data and methods
 
 class myClassName
 {
	private   int    someInteger;
	public    string myMessage;
    protected void   myFunction();	
 }
 
 private     - class member can only be accessed within the class itself
 public      - class member can be accessed by any other object
 protected - class member can be accessed within this class or any subclass (class that inherits from this class)
 internal  - class member can be accessed by any class in the same assembly (package of code like a library or other program);
