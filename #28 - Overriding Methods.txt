 #26 - Overriding Methods
 ----------------------------------------
 
 Being able to change or augment the behaviour of methods in classes,
 known as overriding their logic, is one of the most powerful aspects of OOP
 
 virtual -> Tells the compiler that this method can be overriden by derived class
	public virtual int functionName()
	{
	}
 
 override -> In the subclass, tells the compiler that this method is overriding the same named method in the base class	
  public override int functionName() 
  {
  }
 base -> In the Subclass, calls the base class method	
 if it doesn't call it completely creates a new function
  base.myFunction();
