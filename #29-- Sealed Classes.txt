#26- Sealed Classes
========================


Sealed Classes are the opposite of abstract classes:
	Abstract classes force   you to derive a subclass before use them
	Sealed   Clasess prevent you to derive a subclass beofore use them

Individual methods can also be marked as sealed, which prevents them form being
overriden in subclasses


 It is far more common to seal entire class than methods


public sealed class myClass
{
	
}

public class mySubClass : myClass
{
	// Error in inheriting 
	// cause the base class is sealed
 ........................
}
