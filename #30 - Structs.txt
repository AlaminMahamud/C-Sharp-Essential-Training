  #30 - Structs 
  -----------------------------------------------
  
  structs are similar to classes, with some important differences;
	- Structs don't support inheritence
	- Structs are value type, while classes are referenced types
	- you can't initialize the fields of a struct inside the definition
	
	Structs are usually small and simple
	Structs can havge properties and methdos just like a class
	
	Data type for representing  a point on a 2D surface
	
	public class Point2D
	{
		public int xCoord;
		public int yCoord;
		public Point (int x, int y)
		{
			xCoord = x;
			yCoord = y;
		}
	}
	
	public struct Point2D
	{
		public int xCoord;
		public int yCoord;
		
		public Point(int x, int y)
		{
			xCoord = x;
			yCoord = y;
		}
	
	}
