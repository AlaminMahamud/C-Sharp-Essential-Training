#32 - Exceptions 
--------------------------

An Exception is an error that happens during your program's execution

int x = 10;
int y = 5;

int res = x/y;

but if y = 0;
res = x/y; 		// error divide by 0


Exceptions are raised or thrown, when errors are encountered

program flow interrupted. and control is transferred to the nearest exception handler - the handler catches the exception

if the is no exception handler to process the exception then the exception is terminated with an error code

Exceptions don't just come from .NET - you can built your own exception and raise them yourself with the throw instruction
