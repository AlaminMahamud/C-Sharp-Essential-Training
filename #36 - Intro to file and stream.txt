 When you want to move data into or out of a file, across the network. over the internet, etc. the data has to be  streamed
 
 Stream Data
 
 100000000001110101010....  file + Network
 
 Streams can be readable, writeable or both
 
 Streams can also be seekable - in other words, some types of streams can support a current position that can be queried or modified
 
 All streams descend from the System.IO.Stream abstract base class
 
 Stream ->File Stream
             ->Memory Stream
			 ->Network Stream
