#6 - Type Testing Operators
====================================

is Operator -> returns true if a given object is a certain type
as Operator -> converts a given object to another type (if possible)

 void myFunction(Object obj){
	if(obj is Employee){
		Employee emp = obj as Employee; // null if can't be done;
		string name = emp.FirstName;
		...
	}
 }
